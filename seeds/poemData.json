        I simply don't know why
        Hardly ever, really never
        Spots a worn out tie
        
        But wear a new one, a costly blue one
        A fancy silken job
        If you're like me; I guarantee
        With gravy, you're a slob
        
        Spicy mustard, chocolate custard
        Everybody knows
        Never spill and never will
        When you're wearing your old clothes
        
        But brand new pants don't have a chance
        Hanging on your hips
        Melted cheese, with shocking ease
        Drips right off your lips
        
        So let's suppose food really knows
        When you're dressed up fancy
        I'd still conclude that eating nude
        Would be very chancy."

        And never once drops
        On his forefeet to rest."

        When the lonely moon rides high,
        When wintry winds are whistling,
        And we hear the owls shrill cry,
        In the quiet, dusky chamber,
        By the flickering firelight,
        Rising up between two sleepers,
        Comes a spirit all in white."

        I thought my heart with joy would burst
        So wild was every beat.
        
        No other hand unto my heart
        Could greater pleasure bring
        Than the one so dear I held last night.
        Four Aces and a King."
